This is a cloud image that contains a wildfly java server with a nginx reverse proxy infront of it.

It can be accessed via port 80. The managementport and admin console are also available via this port.
If you need to disable them, then you can disable them by removing the paths from the nginx config.

The default credentials for the management interface are wildfly:w1ldflyadmin!
